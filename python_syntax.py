#Python in my opinion is the easiest of all the programming languages to learn
# and the best one to start programming with.
#It is dynamically typed language which means it determins at runtime, rather than being explicitly declared by the programmer
#You don't need to specify the type of variable, it is done automatically.

# name here represents a variable which is a string
name = "John"

#this is a conditional statement which checks if the value of the variable name is equal to "John"
if name == "John":
    print(name)
    
# the python syntax is very simple, you just need to write the code and it will be executed.
# just worry about the structure of the code. Which consists of the keywords, brackets, operators, etc.
